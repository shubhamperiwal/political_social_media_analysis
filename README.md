# Political Social Media Analysis
In this repository, I'll try to compare Trump, Obama, and Hillary's tweets leading up to the election to come up with meaningful insights

## EDA features
1. Analysis of number of tweets
2. Time series of number of tweets
3. Wordclouds to get most frequent words
4. Sentiment Analysis of the tweets
5. Topic modelling to see what they're talking about


## Possible enhancements
1. Wordcloud in the shape of the speaker
2. Use regex to remove URLs from the tweets
3. Time series X sentiment analysis of the tweets
