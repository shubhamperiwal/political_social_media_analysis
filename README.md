# Political Social Media Analysis
In this repository, I'll try to compare the tweets of Donald Trump, Barack Obama, and Hillary Clinton's tweets leading up to election 2016 to come up with meaningful insights 

## EDA features
1. Analysis of number of tweets
2. Time series of number of tweets
3. Wordclouds to get most frequent words
4. Sentiment Analysis of the tweets
5. Topic modelling to see what they're talking about


## Possible enhancements
1. Wordcloud in the shape of the speaker
2. Use regex to remove URLs and references('@') from the tweets
3. Time series X sentiment analysis of the tweets
4. Further develop the topic modelling technique
